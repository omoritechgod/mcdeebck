# EXACTLY WHAT TO COPY - Session 1

## NEW FILES TO COPY (2 Migration Files)

Copy these NEW files to your test project:

```
FROM: database/migrations/2025_10_07_084640_enhance_food_vendors_table.php
TO:   database/migrations/2025_10_07_084640_enhance_food_vendors_table.php

FROM: database/migrations/2025_10_07_084641_add_indexes_to_food_tables.php
TO:   database/migrations/2025_10_07_084641_add_indexes_to_food_tables.php
```

---

## MODIFIED FILE TO UPDATE (1 Model File)

Replace this ENTIRE file in your test project:

```
FROM: app/Models/FoodVendor.php
TO:   app/Models/FoodVendor.php
```

**OR manually add these changes to FoodVendor.php:**

### Add to $fillable array:
```php
'cuisines',
'estimated_preparation_time',
'latitude',
'longitude',
'operating_hours',
'delivery_radius_km',
'minimum_order_amount',
'delivery_fee',
'is_open',
'accepts_cash',
'accepts_card',
'average_rating',
'total_reviews',
'total_orders'
```

### Add this $casts array after $fillable:
```php
protected $casts = [
    'operating_hours' => 'array',
    'cuisines' => 'array',
    'delivery_radius_km' => 'decimal:2',
    'minimum_order_amount' => 'decimal:2',
    'delivery_fee' => 'decimal:2',
    'is_open' => 'boolean',
    'accepts_cash' => 'boolean',
    'accepts_card' => 'boolean',
    'average_rating' => 'decimal:2',
    'total_reviews' => 'integer',
    'total_orders' => 'integer',
    'estimated_preparation_time' => 'integer',
    'latitude' => 'decimal:7',
    'longitude' => 'decimal:7',
];
```

## OPTIONAL FIX (Only if you get DB error)

If you get an error about DB not being defined when running migrations, update this file:

```
FILE: database/migrations/2025_10_07_075118_update_food_orders_table.php
```

Add this line at the top with other use statements:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
```

---

## AFTER COPYING, RUN:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You should see:
```
Migrating: 2025_10_07_084640_enhance_food_vendors_table
Migrated:  2025_10_07_084640_enhance_food_vendors_table (XX.XXms)

Migrating: 2025_10_07_084641_add_indexes_to_food_tables
Migrated:  2025_10_07_084641_add_indexes_to_food_tables (XX.XXms)
```

## WHY MIGRATIONS DIDN'T RUN BEFORE

The old migration files had timestamps from earlier today (2025_10_07_075XXX and 2025_10_07_081XXX). If you already ran `php artisan migrate` before copying them, Laravel's migrations table marked them as "already migrated" even though they weren't in your database.

The new files have current timestamps (2025_10_07_084640 and 2025_10_07_084641) which are NEWER, so Laravel will recognize them as new migrations that need to run.
